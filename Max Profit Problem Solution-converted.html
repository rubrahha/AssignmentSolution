Corrected Solution
The issue was in how I was calculating earnings and finding all optimal combinations. Here's the fixed algorithm:
python
def calculate_earnings_sequence(t, p, c, n):
    current_time = 0
    earnings = 0
    
    # Calculate for T buildings (built sequentially)
    for _ in range(t):
        build_time = 5
        earnings += 1500 * (n - (current_time + build_time))
        current_time += build_time
        
    # Calculate for P buildings  
    for _ in range(p):
        build_time = 4
        earnings += 1000 * (n - (current_time + build_time))
        current_time += build_time
        
    # Calculate for C buildings
    for _ in range(c):
        build_time = 10
        earnings += 3000 * (n - (current_time + build_time))
        current_time += build_time
        
    return earnings

def solve_max_profit(n):
    max_earning = 0
    best_combos = []
    
    max_t = n // 5
    max_p = n // 4  
    max_c = n // 10
    
    for t in range(max_t+1):
        for p in range(max_p+1):
            for c in range(max_c+1):
                total_time = t*5 + p*4 + c*10
                if total_time <= n:
                    earning = calculate_earnings_sequence(t, p, c, n)
                    if earning > max_earning:
                        max_earning = earning
                        best_combos = [{'T': t, 'P': p, 'C': c}]
                    elif earning == max_earning:
                        best_combos.append({'T': t, 'P': p, 'C': c})
    
    return max_earning, best_combos
Solution for Input n = 49
maxEarnings: 324000
Optimal Combinations Found:
1.	T: 8, P: 2, C: 0
2.	T: 9, P: 0, C: 0
3.	T: 9, P: 1, C: 0
Verification
For T: 9, P: 0, C: 0:
•	9 Theatres built sequentially: 5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = 45 time units
•	Earnings: Theatre 1 operates for (49-5)=44 units → $66,000
•	Theatre 2 operates for (49-10)=39 units → $58,500
•	... and so on
•	Total: $324,000
For T: 8, P: 2, C: 0:
•	8 Theatres (40 time units) + 2 Pubs (8 time units) = 48 time units
•	Total: $324,000
